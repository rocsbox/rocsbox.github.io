    <p>When I met with my advisor prior to this past spring semester, we spoke of my interests and short-term goals.  I told her that I had an impactful conversation with the father of my close friend, and that I wanted to further explore web and content design before the conclusion of my undergraduate education.  We quickly stumbled across Professor Lavin’s course, and I was drawn to it immediately.  I knew that with no prior experience in web or digital media design that there were easier ways to get my writing requirement satisfied; however, I had a strong desire to move forward with the class.</p>
    <p>One of our first assignments was to create our GitHub pages website.  What I now view as a simple task was incredibly intimidating to me at the onset.  I took the time after class to sit down and grind out the HTML essential training videos, desperate to acquire any grasp upon the lines of seemingly random lines of oddly formatted content.  However, as we completed task after task, I found myself growing confident enough to even speak up during class.  I soon realized that these seemingly complex directives were communicating action that was elegant in its simplicity.  Through the use of the inspect and page source web tools, I was able to visualize the actions I was performing in real time.  It was at the conclusion of work-in-progress 2 that I truly felt at ease with the elements we were tasked with learning.  The W3C website, as well as Professor Lavin, enabled me to hone my previously rough concepts into a refined and efficient platform that I have successfully used to communicate media and content.  I will be leaving this class with a firm grasp on the basics of not only HTML, but the complimentary CSS techniques to pair with it.</p>
    <p>I have made it no secret that I had no experience with photoshop prior to this course.  When I first downloaded the application, the sheer amount of icons on the toolbar alone gave me anxiety.  How in the world was I supposed to become proficient enough in these techniques to create content that I would not be embarrassed by…let alone submit.  Thankfully, we were given access a LinkedIn training tutorial that allowed us to hobble through the first activity.  As I went through there rest of the work-in-progress 2 unit, I started to get my feet under me.  I found myself retaining the information I needed to adequately mix and match layers to create one cohesive picture from many.  By the conclusion of the advertisement remix activity, I knew I was going to be okay.  One of my greatest triumphs in this course was creating the Lego Driver poster during our second activity.  With the assistance of our LinkedIn tutorials, as well as the internet, I found myself performing edits that I never thought I would reach.  During this process, I used filters, fill settings, smart objects, foreign tool bar attachments, layer styles, pattern overlays, and even linear light settings.  During my zoom calls with Professor Matt, I could hardly contain my excitement upon the completion of this specific activity.  It was truly a milestone for me in this class.</p>
    <p>The only prior sound editing experience that I had prior to our Audacity unit was messing around with the Garage Band application on my middle school’s apple computers.  I felt more comfortable going into this unit than the ones preceding because I was familiar with organizing track elements to start and stop in the form of a cohesive beat.  I was appreciative of the Audacity tutorials we were assigned, as it opened my eyes to a host of different manipulations, we could overlay our sound files with.  Instead of a choppy mix of sounds, we were able to use the different tools to boost, reduce, fade in/out, repeat, and alter tempo of our sound files.  At the end of this unit, I was tasked with creating a soundscape.  I used one of our online resources to gather a library of sounds that one would find in a hospital.  I wanted to create a cohesive unit of files that were appropriately blended into the sounds you would hear walking through the floors of a medical facility.  I used a hospital corridor as a consistent base sound.  Following this, I mixed and matched sound files such as a toilet flush, helicopter blades, a baby ward, employee dialogue, and much more to create my auditory environment.  I was happy that using the various tools found in Audacity I was able to blend the sounds together.  My biggest worry was that it would sound choppy.  By amplifying and reducing different files at various checkpoints, I was able to highlight specific files at key moments.  By using the fade in and out functions, I was satisfied with the various files blending being a cohesive track that did not have random sounds starting and stopping but instead gradually beginning and ending.  At the conclusion of this unit, I was happy with the progress I had made.</p>
    <p>The target audience for my GitHub Pages Site changed several times during my initial design process.  Initially, I wanted to design a baseball statistic database whose target audience were people seeking to inform themselves.  I moved on from that to a food diary that could educate the pallets of those visiting.  In the end, I created a personal website that was the extension of my coursework.  The goal of this was to create an intimate parlor of professionalism.  A place that efficiently conveyed the information I need to, that did so in a manner that was lighthearted and fun.  I think I was successful in doing so.  The color scheme that I implemented was coordinated, and subconsciously afforded the viewer visual cues that helped them understand where to find information.  Implementing affordances of the medium was a central concept to the course.  I relied on this principle heavily.  An example of this is that I implemented a CSS function that enabled the user’s cursor to highlight main menu and sub menu links to indicate that interaction would lead them to another page.  By allowing this assumption, I believe the user could efficiently use the shortcuts I implemented throughout the site. </p>
    <p>As I bring my participation in this course to a close, I am proud with what I have accomplished.  Despite my difficulties throughout this semester, I believe that I did not shortchange myself.  What I mean by this, is that I walk away with a skillset that I did not have prior to the start of the course.  I am now proficient in the basics of HTML and CSS web design.  I am able to navigate, and perform appropriate actions, in the photoshop application…of which my personal group chats will be entertained with for years to come.  My sound editing skills have taken an immense leap from the days I used to create simple drum and base files as a child.  When it comes time for me to graduate, I will not be leaving this newfound skillset behind.  I plan on advancing my web design education to diversify my skillset further.  I am thankful for the opportunity to finish this class properly and look forward to how I can use these skills in my career.</p>

    <p>In recent months, I have communicated daily with my brother Anthony who is a physician at Temple University Hospital.  I like to check in with him each day to make sure he is in good spirits given the stress he is under during this difficult time.  For my soundscape project, I have decided to compose a piece that reflects the environment one might find in a hospital.  It will be an auditory journey that will make someone feel as if they are walking through the various floors of your standard hospital.</p>

    <p>If I could go back and reimagine one of my activities from the course, it would be the advertisement remix activity. (pictured below)  While I am happy with how the project turned out, my knowledge of photoshop was limited at the time.  As I look over it now, it satisfies the requirements of the activity.  However, I believe that I could do better on a second attempt.  Instead of a crude series of arrows pointing towards their modern advertisement, I would instead create a dual frame image.  The top would include the defaced clown version of the original advertisement.  I must admit I did enjoy editing Galaga onto his screen.  Instead of using the entirely new image that I chose to, I would use the base image from the original advertisement.  With my newfound skills, I feel as if I could reimagine the looks of the character into a modern-day entity.  Instead of cassette tapes to his right, the stack would be his work and personal iPhone.  I would also cut out the original device depicted in the advert and cut the new device I found into place.  I believe that I could successfully blend this into the background.  Upon completion of this, I would simulate the font in the original advertisement, and write a few lines on how the company has advanced in the years since this original product was produced.</p>

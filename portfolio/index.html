    <h2> Soundscape </h2>
    <p>In recent months, I have communicated daily with my brother Anthony who is a physician at Temple University Hospital.  I like to check in with him each day to make sure he is in good spirits given the stress he is under during this difficult time.  For my soundscape project, I have decided to compose a piece that reflects the environment one might find in a hospital.  It will be an auditory journey that will make someone feel as if they are walking through the various floors of your standard hospital.</p>

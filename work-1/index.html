    <div><h2>Work in Progress 1</h2></div>
    <p>When I signed up for this class, I was initially nervous that I had never been exposed to this kind of material before.  Coding, photoshop, and sound editing were all foreign concepts to me.  It all stems from a conversation I had with the father of one of my good friends.  I asked him how I could diversify my skillset in a way that made me more marketable to hiring firms.  He recommended I expose myself to material similar to what we cover in this class.  When I saw that it also satisfied a writing requirement, I knew that this was the chance to better myself as well as further my educational career.</p>
    <p>As we familiarized ourselves with GitHub, and the class got underway, I was excited by what we were learning.  The complexities of html language in reality are a beautiful simplicity.  The inspect options on browsers, as well as the w3 try it yourself pages, allow you to see the correlation between the lines of code and the display you see on the webpage.</p>
    <p>One of our class activities that you can find at the Embedded Fiction link under work in progress 1 of this website was an actual pleasure to create.  It is rare that I have a creative freedom in the classroom, as I am generally learning statistical analysis techniques.  I took this opportunity, and ran with it.  I knew immediately that it would be fun to create a fake amazon product and review.  Upon completion, I realized I could take it a step further.  Instead of just displaying simple text, I cut and compiled the different pieces of the product I altered and its webpage to create a seemingly real product complaint.</p>
    <p>The second assignment is one that I had some trouble with.  I went back to the drawing board three or four times because my initial thought was much to large for the task we were given.  Initially, I thought we were creating an entire website instead of an online medium for our self and class work.  I had thoughts of creating my own baseball data website, or a food blog.  As our class continued to meet, I realized the task at hand was far from what I had been brainstorming.  Upon this realization, I came to grips with how I wanted my personal site to be formatted.  My mind wandered to the relaxed professionalism of a library bar I enjoy in the city of Toronto.  I set out to add CSS to my GitHub to best represent what I was feeling.</p>
    <p>My initial attempt to add CSS to the site resulted in many failures.  I was attempting to create a blanket body CSS platform that influenced everything evenly.  However, as I continued to experiment, I gained more experience in how my adjustments would influence the page layout.   I scrapped the blanket attempt, and instead set out to establish CSS rules for each element of my pages.  This helped me stay more organized and allowed me to be precise in what I was trying to do.  This H1 is square and dotted...that H2 is encapsulated by a solid round box etc. etc. </p>
    <p>Upon adding color to my pages, I realized that some of the initial pigments I wanted to use did not fit.  The deep forest green honestly looked like thick crayon.  This stood out to me in a bad way.  I instead used dark sea green, which felt more calming.  When I initially laid the gold over the green for my headings and such, it was harder to read than I expected.  At the same time, I noticed that the blue base color of my links fit much more appropriately.  I elected to use a blue violet color as the color of any text of main headers and links.  I enjoyed how the golden-brown fit over the standard white background of the webpage and applied this accordingly for my p elements.</p>
    <p>One of the additions I am most proud of is my use of the div element to wrap my H2’s found throughout the site.  This enabled me to create page breaks that are similar in their usage to the one is we can find on our class website.  Instead of using a standard box, or dotted box like I did with my header and footer, I used a rounded box that felt unique to me.  Instead of my links being along the side of my webpage, I instead listed them vertically at the center of each page.  I also made it so that the sub links of the page you are on are at the bottom to minimize travel distance of the user’s cursor when they are quickly browsing through.</p>
    <p>The biggest difficulty I had was an error I had at the top of my home page.  I realized that I had a spare div element before my H1.  This was creating a large blob of green boxes that was incredibly frustrating to see.  Upon removal, the page looked as I had designed it to…which was an extreme relief.</p>
    <p>At the end of this checkpoint, I feel like I have achieved the look that I desired.  The site to me displays a coy seriousness.  The colors I used do not feel over done, and the information is readily accessible.  Moving forward, I am excited to develop my photoshop skills.  In this past checkpoint, I used a rudimentary skill set to create my embedded fiction review image.  Having learned more about the uses of photoshop I now realize there were more efficient ways to create that file.  I am also excited to continue to tweak my site design.  The last unit of the class involved video and sound editing, which I have little to not experience of.  While I am intimidated, I look forward to the challenge.</p>

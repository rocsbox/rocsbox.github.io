    <h4) Product Review for the Wickedbone Smart Bone, Automatic & Interactive Toys for Dogs, Puppy and Cats, App Control, Safe & Durable, Keep Your Pets Entertained All Day</h4>
    <p> Question: Did anyone else’s dog start acting strangely after purchase of the WickedboneSmart Bone?</p>
    <p> Hello,</p>
    &nbsp;
    <p> My  name  is  Jane,  and  I  recently  purchased  the  Wickedbone  Smart  Bone  for  my  corgi Samantha.  I purchased this item in hopes of growing closer with my newly adopted princess, as it is advertised to help a new pet owner interact with their puppy.  However, I was unaware of the voice feature embedded into the device.  AT first, I thought that it was innocent and funny...saying things such as “I love you”, or “youre a good boy.”  But as time went on, the dog insisted via behavior to sleep withthe smart bone.  I did not think much of it, until my husband Tyler stumbled upon Samantha gazing over the glowing bone in the middle of the night.  He overheard sinister words being emitted from the machine, and our poor corgi Samantha appeared to be ensnared by the deep blue light.   He tried to take the bone away, and our sweet Samantha snarled at him and bit him to the point of drawing blood.  Anyway, I’ve drolled on here long enough...I was hoping to use this forum to find other owners were experiencingthe same thing.  #corgimom #pupowner </p>

    <div><h2>Envisioning Design Homework</h2></div>
    <div><h2>Final Revision</h2></div>
    <p>I have gone back to the drawing board several times in search of an appropriate theme for my portfolio website.  My vision was one of seriousness, that would still convey a bright personality. I had difficulty picturing what this would look like for some time.  As I developed this idea, I found myself drawn to one of my favorite lounges in Toronto, the Fairmont Library Bar.</p>
    <p>My goal is to try and express the theme of an intimate parlor of professionalism to the readers of this site.  It is my personal opinion, that while one is lounging in the FairmontLibrary Bar they are overcome with a sense of an alluring and relaxed atmosphere which fosters a peaceful ambiance enabling focus.  I find this atmosphere most exemplary of the emotions I want to elicit from my readers.</p>
    <p>To appropriately convey a library bar experience, I will be using a deep forest green paired with old gold and golden-brown elements.  Additionally, I will be using Baskerville Old Face as my font, which exudes a luxuriant feel of elegance and perfect symmetry.  Should the readers browser not hold this value, I will set Serifas the default.</p>
    <p>In typography, kerning is the process of adjusting the spacing between characters in a proportional font.  I plan on experimenting with this typeface manipulation to advance my themed message of intimate professionalism.  Also, I would like to establish an h1 border to the “Rocco’s GitHubPages” header, and experiment with where the menu will appear on each page.  The picture foundbelow is of the bar café I am aspiring to mimic so that you may have a reference.</p>

    <div><h2>First Revision</h2></div>
    <p>After thinking about our website design, and how to make it a more personable platform, I have decided to create a food diary of sorts.  I think that this would serve as a more effective conduit between a personal hobby of mine, and my academic focus.  The top of the home page will be a large header composed of turquois, with a centralized “Food Links” in large font (the name of the site).  A few spaces below, will be a centralized menu of the same color, with links taking you to different places.  There will be 2-inch margins from each side of blank space.  This is to convey a modern and simplistic style to the visitor.  The body of the site will be an activity feed with the latest topic additions. There will be a small picture, with a paired article title centered to the right, that will take you to the review/recipe page.  At the base of the page, there will be the same menu found below the logo header.  Following the second menu, there will be contact Information displayed in order of a mailing address, and email address, and social media links.</p>
    <p>I hope for this to become a data base for my family recipes, a digital cookbook so to speak, that will be openly displayed for others to try.  Below the main header, there will be a menu composed of the following content links.  A Cuisine Section that will lead you to different food type compilations. i.e. Italian cuisine, Thaicuisine, Spanish cuisine, American cuisine.  These would appear in a drop-down menu when you highlight the cuisine section.  Clicking one of these links would send you to the page ascribed to the individual cuisine type...with an activity feed relating to tagged recipes.  Clicking these would take you to the individual recipe page.  Each recipe with be equipped with a picture, a short description, and instructions following an ingredient list.  In addition to this, there will be a dining out section where I will list my recent restaurant experiences.  This will be organized like the cuisine section above, where an “on the go” will drop down to categorical sections that lead to different groups of activity feeds...Healthy, Italian, Thai, etc....where you can find a review upon clicking links found in said feeds.  Following these, there will be a about me page with a fleshed-out version of our biopic activity from class.  The about me page will be text in paragraph form, next to a picture of myself....and of course, social media links.</p>

    <h2>Envisioning Design Homework</h2>
    <p>After thinking about our website design, and how to make it a more personable platform, I have decided to create a food diary of sorts.  I think that this would serve as a more effective conduit between a personal hobby of mine, and my academic focus.  The top of the home page will be a large header composed of turquois, with a centralized “Food Links” in large font (the name of the site).  A few spaces below, will be a centralized menu of the same color, with links taking you to different places.  Therewill be 2-inchmargins from each side of blank space.  This is to convey a modern and simplistic style to the visitor.  The body of the site will be an activity feed with the latest topic additions. There will be a small picture, with a paired article title centered to the right, that will take you to the review/recipe page.  At the base of the page, there will be the same menu found below the logo header.  Following the second menu, there will be contact Information displayed in order of a mailing address, and email address, and social media links.</p>
    <p>I hope for this to become a data base for my family recipes, a digital cookbookso to speak, that will be openly displayed for others to try.Below the main header, there will be a menu composed of the followingcontent links.  A Cuisine Section that will lead you to differentfood typecompilations.i.e.Italian cuisine, Thaicuisine, Spanish cuisine, American cuisine.  These would appear in a drop-downmenu when you highlight the cuisinesection.  Clicking on one of these links would send you to the page ascribed to theindividual cuisine type...with an activity feed relating to tagged recipes.  Clicking these would take you to the individual recipe page.  Each recipe with be equipped with a picture, a short description, and instructions following an ingredient list.  In addition to this, there will be a dining out section where I will list my recent restaurant experiences.  This will be organized like the cuisine section above, where an “on the go” will drop down to categorical sections that lead to different groups of activity feeds...healthy, Italian, Thai, etc....where you can find a review upon clicking links found in said feeds.  Following these, there will be a about me pagewith a fleshed-outversion of our biopic activity from class.  The about me page will be text in paragraph form, next to a picture of myself....and of course, social media links.</p>

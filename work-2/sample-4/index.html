    <div><h2> Final Revision </h2></div>
    <p> Below is the final form of my logo photoshop activity.  Unlike in my original design, I decided to add a color scheme to the product.  I aproached the logo with simplicity in mind. More details of this project can be found in my work-in-progress 2 reflection.</p>

    <div><h2>First Revision</h2></div>
    <p>A business idea that I have kicked around with my cousin has been to open up a food truck that utilizes our family recipes.  This would be something we did in our twilight years, unless we created a solvent business model that could support us.  The idea is centered around these small gas-powered ovens that create an environment similar to a large coal fired brick oven.  These are the closest ovens we could find that we could realistically purchase for out homes without having to devote a large space to the oven.  We would implement a McDonalds like menu that is very simplistic and try to optimize our inventory by stocking high selling food items, while limiting and excluding items that would eat up space and our budget.  The food items would be personal pizzas, of which we have a variety of recipes.  We were thinking margarita, broccoli rob and sausage, pepperoni/ soppressata, four cheese, and a mozzarella with tomato pizza to top her off.  Along with these pizzas, we would sell baked wings cooked in a skillet with peppers and onions.  Refreshments would also be available…but the idea is to pump out what we are good at, and not include luxury items like milkshakes or random processed desserts.  Our niche is in the quality of our ingredients, and the care that goes into making our products.  The company name would be Pizzeria Benevento.  Clearly, a place that sells pizza…that also pays homage to a city in Italy where the bulk of our family is from…which also provides a trace to our recipes.  This is the first time I have attempted to think on a logo for our food truck.  What comes to mind now would be a a logo of these ovens that are the heart of our business.  I do not want to add any cheesy coloring to it (ha pun intended), but would rather have it be a blacked out with white space oven with a central gap that has a flame.  Above the oven would lie Pizzeria, and below would contain Benevento…both in block style lettering.  I enjoy the simplicity of this design.  Our company name itself defines us as a pizzeria, and our oven emblem would hint to pizza lovers that we use a unique method of baking that sets our pies apart from the rest. </p>

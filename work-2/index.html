    <p>I have found that throughout this unit I was able to further develop my mastery in the essential skills of HTML and CSS.  One HTML error I noticed needed fixing was that the some of my .html pages on GitHub had a text error where I never included a submenu.  This was causing my menu and submenu to merge, creating an unpleasant blob of green on the screen.  After patching this, and discussing the site with Professor Lavin, I made some additional adjustments to the corresponding CSS elements to further improve the look of the site.  After adding these padding and adjustment elements, I set my eyes on making the user more aware of what page they were on.  I made an alteration that lined the link the user was visiting in the violet coloring found in other places on the site.  Links that the user would be able to select appear now as a darker hue so that they may distinguish them from the active link.  </p>
    <p>I added an additional folder to the repository of my site during this stage of the process.  The checklist for asynchronous activities was added to the course after we transitioned to online classes.  I used the w3 website for a reference on to how to properly build the tables.  In addition, I added matching CSS formatting into my styles folder that allowed the table to blend in with the rest of the site.  </p>
    <p>If we had presented our Pecha Kucha to the class before our online transition, we were to import the iframe video link that would play our presentation in a sort of visual slideshow.  After doing this, I decided to change the html names to the various pages and links of the site.  Instead of the standard work-in-progress and work-in-progress-presentation labels, I used a more specific link guides like Checkpoint 1, 2, and Pecha Kucha.  I feel as if this creates a more pleasurable experience for any visitor leafing through my pages.</p>
    <p>One of our first tasks was to pick a genre, and corresponding movie, with the objective being a redesign of the poster in such a way that altered oneâ€™s opinion of what genre said movie belonged to.  For my assignment, I chose the movie Baby Driver.  I duplicated my initial poster and made this duplicate a smart layer.  After that I, pixelate the image.  Following this pixilation, I made a second document of a width and length that corresponded to the pixels of the distorted image.  Following this, I made several adjustments to the layer to create a singular brick unit of adjusted dimensions and colorations.  I made this image a pattern, overlaid it to the smart object layer and created the image you see on the site.</p>
    <p>An additional class activity was to alter the genre of an old advertisement.  I decided to do a parody remix of an older computer ad.  I found it to be a learning experience in using multiple images and layers in a photoshop project.  At the time, I was still unfamiliar with what tool bar icons corresponded to what tool.  This activity helped me grow my skills in the application.</p>
    <p>Our third assignment was to create a storyboard arc using a class concept or our Pecha Kucha topic.  I used my Pecha Kucha designation, Exposure Effect.  My goal was to transform my PowerPoint presentation into a comic of a teacher presenting said presentation to the class.  I created an image of a professor next to a chalkboard wearing a mask presenting different posters to the class with corresponding dialogue in the adjacent box.  This project helped me utilize the skills I had begun to develop in the previous activities.</p>
    <p>The last activity listed in my work-in-progress 2 collection was a logo activity.  I used a sketch drawing I made in class as the template.  To begin, I utilized the ellipse tool found along the photoshop toolbar and created several different arcs that would become a seemingly three-dimensional object.   I also had trouble illustrating flames using a cursor, so I detached my surface from its keyboard attachment.  Once I did this, I used the surface pen to carefully illustrate flames using the appropriate color wheels.  I used a background layer to fill in the blank space behind the oven properly.  To encapsulate the image, I surrounded the object in a turquoise circle.  To top off this minimalist design, I created the name of the food truck below the oven using the same color as the encapsulating circle.</p>
    <p>At the conclusion of this segment of the class I am excited by how much progress I have made in both photoshop and web design.  I find myself being able to code much faster than previously because I have a far greater grasp on how to influence my webpages than I did at the start of the first unit.  As someone who had never used photoshop prior to this pas unit, I am proud of how much I learned in a short amount of time.  I will be able to take these skills with me and use them in not only professional settings, but in my personal life as well.</p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Greetings, my name is Rocco LaCava and I am an Economics major at the University of Pittsburgh.  I will be graduating this coming fall, and am pursuing a career in data analysis.  I am a Pittsburgh native, and am proud to say I attended Pittsburgh Central Catholic High School.  I am the youngest of three children, and have recently welcomed a puppy and nephew to the family as well. </p>
      
    <p>While I enjoy crunching numbers in class, one of my favorite hobbies is cooking.  My family and I are Italian, and we use food to keep in touch with our heritage.  We have progressed over the past decade and a half by trying to be as authentic as possible in what we eat.  As well as ensuring our ingredients are of the highest quality we can manage.  My hopes for this blog is to empart some of our personal culture onto others, as well as enhance peoples overall diet with other recipes we have stumbled upon along the way.</p>

    <div><h2>Final Revision</h2></div>
    <p>Greetings, and welcome to my personal website biopic.  My name is Rocco LaCava, and I am a senior at the University of Pittsburgh.  I was born and raised in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  Prior to my enrollment at Pitt, Iattended Pittsburgh Central Catholic High School.  My short-term goals are to finish my undergraduate experience after this fall 2020 semester, as well as to continue to garner work and life experience.</p>
    <p>I have a wide assortment of interests that include following various athletic teams, experiencing the world of videogames, pretending I am a gourmet chef, and exploring abroad.  I come from a sports-oriented family.  My father works for a company associated with Major League Baseball, and my siblings and I each were kept busy throughout our respective childhoods via athletics.  Before there was sport, there was the E sport for me.  I did not have an interest in sports, aside from playing them, until well into high school.  Thus, I spent most of my time enthralled in digital environments.  Apart from athletic fandom and gaming, I pride myself on my ability to cook.  I enjoy trying new recipes and adding personal twists to ones I find online or in a family cookbook.  Finally, I have been fortunate enough to travel abroad to Canada and Europe several times.  I feel that these experiences have had a positive impact on my personal ethics and my perception of the world around me.</p>
    <p>Through this site, I will create a readily accessible online portfolio of the work that I create in my Composing Digital Media class here at Pitt.  What it will eventually become remains to be seen, and that is exciting.  If you have read this far, feel free to explore the various links to the pages that express my development throughout the class.</p>

    <p>Greetings, my name is Rocco LaCava and I am an Economics major at the University of Pittsburgh.  I will be graduating this coming fall, and am pursuing a career in data analysis.  I am a Pittsburgh native, and am proud to say I attended Pittsburgh Central Catholic High School.  I am the youngest of three children, and have recently welcomed a puppy and nephew to the family as well. </p> 
    <p>While I enjoy crunching numbers in class, one of my favorite hobbies is cooking.  My family and I are Italian, and we use food to keep in touch with our heritage.  We have progressed over the past decade and a half by trying to be as authentic as possible in what we eat.  As well as ensuring our ingredients are of the highest quality we can manage.  My hopes for this blog is to empart some of our personal culture onto others, as well as enhance peoples overall diet with other recipes we have stumbled upon along the way.</p>
